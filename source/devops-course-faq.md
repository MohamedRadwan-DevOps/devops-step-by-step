## **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

These are some of the questions I received and my answers to them:

**Q1: Will I be qualified to work as a DevOps Engineer after finishing the course?**

A1: Yes as a Junior DevOps Eng. Even though this course is an advanced introduction, you shall be fully capable of applying for a job and working, because my main objective is to properly build and equip you for the actual job market. Also, it depends on other knowledge and skills you have and remember, you need time in an actual DevOps job to get the real experience.

**Q2: It is unclear what tools we shall use, whether they are Azure DevOps or Jenkins? Will we work with Configuration Management Tools such as Ansible or Teraform? Will we get into subjects like Kubernetes and Docker?**

A2: We will use Azure DevOps, but no Jenkins. Yes of course we will work with Configuration Management Tools and it will be Teraform. As for Docker, we shall definitely get into it, but Kubernetes will be just theoretical.

Also, there is another extremely important thing: the course objective is not to learn tools or technologies, but rather the practices and the principles regardless of tools or technology.

However, to learn the practices, we must apply them using any tools or technology. You can literally apply what you will learn using any other tools or technology not just the ones you’ve learned in class, and this is an additional advantage to the course: Because you have understood the foundation, tools and technology became much easier to understand and use any of them.

**Q3: When shall the course start? How shall I pay? Is there a deadline for payment?**

A3: The course has two class to join, English and Arabic. 

So, if you are interested in joining the **English** class, please contact our Financial Manager in UK, Ms. Rania via WhatsApp on the following [link](https://wa.me/201224073193) or send a text to this no. (00201224073193)

But, if you are interested in joining the **Arabic** class, please contact our Financial Manager in Egypt, Ms. Nadia via WhatsApp on the following [link](https://wa.me/201224073193) or send a text to this no. (00201224073193)

Also, I will announce the course start date for each round on Linked-In and Facebook. So, if you couldn’t enroll in this time, you could try with the next round or the one after.

Moreover, the timing shall be updated on the following timetable page:

[Timetable](https://github.com/MohamedRadwan-DevOps/devops-step-by-step/blob/main/none-community/course-schedule.md)

And it is best you take a look at the reviews left by those who have finished the course. Each and every one of them explains how they benefited from the course and shares their experience that might be very close to your case and thereby answering all your questions.

**Q4: Will the course be useful in Mobile Application? I have taken the Programming Fundamentals Course before with Eng. Moshrif, will it benefit me? How will DevOps benefit me afterwards?**

A4: The Course shall be useful in any specialization in software whether it's a mobile application, back-end, or full-stack because it covers the foundation of the software industry practices and principles in terms of the product’s life cycle and enhancing its performance. 

Of course, a programming fundamentals course will make a huge difference especially if you took it with Eng. Moshrif. 

You can also work in DevOps roles; it has a huge market demand all over the world, especially in the UK and EU.



**Q5: I’ve taken an overview of DevOps in a Data Warehousing class in college but in fact, the field itself is a bit unclear. If you could just give us a hint on what it is and the available opportunities for it and will it be a complement to a career in Full stack development?**

A5: It is not a complement to a career in Full Stack development, it is a whole new direction. But, if you are a full stack developer, then it is a good thing because it will help you a lot.

**Q6: Is the course mostly theoretical aimed at understanding the concepts of DevOps?**

A6: The course is very practical, and you’ll have hands-on experience and do everything yourself from A to Z, it has more than 83 Demos/Labs you will learn and do them yourself, see the following link for the list of Demos/Labs for the course.

[Demos/Labs](https://github.com/MohamedRadwan-DevOps/devops-step-by-step/blob/main/none-community/course-demos-labs.md)

**Q7: Will there be an advanced level course immediately after or will there be a long time period between both courses?**

A7: The course shall be very rich. I don’t want to say, “just you handle this one and then worry about the next one later on!”. I just want you to consider this course is the foundation and enough for you to start working. (But you’ll graduate from it like a GP physician or a first-year engineering student) The purpose of this course is for you to be properly built and ready for work and for you to actually know how to do the work itself but it will not make you a specialist or an expert. This is something that must come with simultaneous work-study

There are no more courses ready at the moment. Of course, it will take some time from me to prepare any more courses but hopefully, it won’t take long.

**Q8: What are the jobs I can apply for after finishing the course? Because I’m currently working as a system analyst, and I want to make a career shift**

A8: There is more than one professional level for DevOps as well as more than one sub-specialization. But as an entry level you shall be able apply for:

- DevOps Engineer
- Platform Engineer

**Q9: Is there a Certification track with Exams?**

A9: NO, only an attendance certificate.

**Q10: I’ve locally installed Gitlab as well as Docker Security with Trivy Scanner, and I have some information about DevOps. I’ve tried a few labs of Qwiklabs. But I’m seeing a great experience obviously in the course, especially in Module 7 is marvelous but to be clear on what my goals are, I’m doing all this to be a DevSecOps Engineer. So, what I need is Kubernetes as well as Gitlab (CI) and integration of course. I know you are doing something that suits everyone but, I need your advice.**

A10: This course does not use Gitlab, it uses Azure pipeline instead. For you to be a DevSecOps Engineer, you have to be a good, properly built DevOps engineer first because DevSecOps is an advanced stage of DevOps. And this course provides an introduction to DevSecOps but we will not get into details.

The course will be a an advanced leap in your way of thinking and in your work in the field. So, my advice is, forget everything and start with me from scratch, my way, and hopefully you’ll see the result and you’ll even impress yourself with what you’ll be capable of doing.

**Q11 What is the difference between AWS and Azure? And do I have to have a Linux background or at least know something about it because I know nothing about Linux?**

A11: Those are two different companies that provide cloud services, and no you don’t have to be an expert but you should know basic bash script; you shall learn all that in the course.
You can review all the prerequisites of the course on the following link:

[Course prerequisites](https://github.com/MohamedRadwan-DevOps/devops-step-by-step/blob/main/none-community/course-info-prerequisite.md)


**Q12: How important is it to have a credit card in the course? And will money be withdrawn from it? And what if I don’t have a credit card, what shall I do?**

A12: The credit card is for free registration on Microsoft Azure Cloud that will provide you with $200 worth of free services. And no money shall be withdrawn from your card, because I shall teach you how to deactivate this feature.

If you don’t have a credit card?

You can pay me $100 to add you to my premium cloud account so you can practice the labs and the exercises.

Make sure the card is a credit card not a debit card as you might not be able to register an account with a debit card.

[A similar question about the same case and the answer to it](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/433827/how-to-get-an-azure-account-without-credit-card.html)

**Q13: Will we get into AWS? Is it more desirable in the market?**

A13: No, we shall not get to apply on AWS But, in the end, AWS and Azure are both cloud service provider. The different only in terms of application not in terms of knowledge or concepts.

The course objective is not to learn tools or technology like AWS or Azure, but rather to learn the practices and the principles regardless of any tools or technology.

However, to learn the practices, we must apply them using any tools or technology. You can literally apply what you will learn using any other tools or technology not just the ones you’ve learned in class, and this is an additional advantage to the course: Because you have understood the foundation, tools and technology became much easier to understand and use any of them.

In the end AWS and Azure have market demands almost equally.



**Q14: What if I don’t have the course requirements/prerequisites?**

A14: In that case, try developing a simple software program like a timetable or phone-book using ASP.NET MVC, reading up a lot on SDLC, get quick overview about bash and Power shell and some basic fundamental about DB and you should be ready, don't spend too long.

We are going to code and develop a simple software in the course. So, I don’t want your first time seeing or writing code to be in the course; you have to come prepared so you can keep up.

**Q15: Will the course and lectures be recorded in case I couldn’t attend live sessions?**

A15: Yes, the lectures shall be recorded and available for free for 4 days you shall be choosing in advance. However, if you want a permanent recording of the lecture, the price of a single lecture will be an additional $25. That is why I am stressing the importance of attendance and not skipping.

**Q16: Are there any more advantages to the course?**

A16: The course shall have technical support and a free subscription to the mentorship program for the first 3 months.

Your mentor shall be able to solve any problems you might face or answer any question you might have. And I shall personally supervise the program to make sure it lives up to the desired standard.

[This link is for more information on the mentorship program](https://github.com/MohamedRadwan-DevOps/devops-step-by-step/blob/main/none-community/mentoring-service.md)

**Q17: How much does the technical support or mentorship program cost?**

A17: First of all, the technical support or mentorship program is an optional choice and not mandatory. The subscription fees is $7/month and it's payed annually which means $84/year.

Also, the mentorship and the technical support are free for people who contribute to our internal community.

[This link is for more information on the mentorship program](https://github.com/MohamedRadwan-DevOps/devops-step-by-step/blob/main/none-community/mentoring-service.md)

**Q18: Are there any more advantages to the technical support or mentorship program?**

A18: The top 20 to 50 people in the mentorship or technical support, those who are the best and the most diligent students in the course, who provide the most follow-up and the best solutions to technical support problems, shall be nominated to work for companies in the UK or EU.

**Q19: Will I be able to work in this field as a fresh graduate with no experience?**

A19: If you are a graduate of this field and were basically clever, committed, and made a lot of effort in the course, hopefully after you finish you shall be able to work better than those who have been in the field for five years, but you have to make a significant amount of effort in the course and also target the junior job as it will be impossible to join as a Senior DevOps which needs a lot of real experience.

But, if you are not a graduate of the field nor do you have experience in programming, then you definitely need a lot of time to comprehend and apply. Our field is generally that of patience and endurance.

**Q20: Unfortunately, I haven’t successfully found a job yet. What do you suggest I do to make good use of my time till the course starts?**

A20: Watch my DevOps videos on my Youtube channels.


For **English speaking**, watch the ([Best Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe14MLC-Nwy5u0w1mD1l2kEiKW16ZlMYG)) playlist. Those videos with make a huge difference.

For **Arabic speaking**, watch the ([DevOps-Step-by-Step](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe14MLC-Nwy5u0w1mD1l2kEiKW16ZlMYG)) playlist. Those videos with make a huge difference.


**Q21: What are the minimum system requirements for the course?**

A21:

- Processor (CPU): Intel Core i5 (sixth generation or newer) or equivalent
- Operating System: Microsoft Windows 10 Professional x64
- Memory 8/16 GB RAM
- Storage: 500 GB internal storage drive
- Internal or external Webcam (webcam must be opened during all sessions)

**Q22: Is there anything else I need to know about the course?**

A22: You need to know that this is a demanding course and the more you focus and effort you put in the course, the more you benefit from it. Also, you must know that there is significant preparation that you must do before every lecture and after every lecture there shall be an assessments that you must take, see the following link for the list of Demos/Labs for the course.

[Demos/Labs](https://github.com/MohamedRadwan-DevOps/devops-step-by-step/blob/main/none-community/course-demos-labs.md)



**A23: How do I attend the lectures?**

A23: A meeting invitation shall be sent a week before every lecture via Microsoft Teams to the email used in registration. Also, a demo invitation shall be sent before the course starts and there is a discord channel to join so if you have any questions or issues, you can ask there.

**Q24: What is the deadline for course registration?**

A24: The registration deadline for any course is two weeks prior to the course start date.
