## I want to contribute but I don't know what to do?
You need to learn what does it means to be a contributor and I am trying to help everyone here.
To start contribution for this project or any other projects. There are only 3 ways to do that…..

1. If you don’t’ like anything in the project, you see an improvement or you have a suggestion, just fork and do it in your fork (repo) then raise a PR (Pull Request).
2. If you don’t want to do that, just raise an issue/enhancement/bug, etc. on GitHub issues.
3. You can also try to solve opened issues, vote for issues or discussion, comment, or discuss to improve the content, etc.


## What if I raised or opened an issue and it is deleted without any comment?
If it’s deleted without any comments, it means you failed to provide the minimum of a good question or it's out of the scope, try to read the good question guidelines again and review the FAQ page very well.


## What if I raised a Pull Request (PR) and it is not accepted?
If it’s not accepted without any comments, it means you failed to provide any value compared to the time needed to provide a feedback for you, therefore always do a PR which has small changes and learn how to provide small values first. Just think if you can really provide a value, no one will reject that value even if it’s very small but if your PR has many changes and the feedback will take long time to explain and report it to you than to do the task itself, probably you will not receive a feedback.
E.g. if you correct a spelling mistake in few words or fix broken links and raise a PR, no one will reject that 😊

So, again, always do a small PR and learn from the feedback from your mistakes.


## What is needed to contributor to the community?
You need to learn the culture of the community, some of that as the following:
- Honest and transparent
- Contributor vs. Consumer
- Initiative and Proactive vs. Reactive 
- Actions vs. suggestions
- Deep reading and adhering to details
- Do your homework first before asking for help or for more info
- No repeated questions  
- Welling to help before seeking recognition
- Quality of contribution  
- Welling and looking for feedback even if it’s too tough 
- Community only opens the door, you have to walk through it


## Can I ask any question regarding any subject outside the session topic?

No, you are only allowed to ask related questions to the discussed topics.
Most of the questions will be at the end of the session, but you can ask a few questions during the session.
